This is a special repo for hosting Akrynix's health files and our organization profile. It has two main uses:

## Organization Landing Page

The README in the profile directory will render on our organization home page.

## Default Community Health Files

Community health files are files such as CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, issue templates and other important files for enterprise-level management. Files defined in this repo will provide a fallback / default for any organization repo that doesn't have one of its own.

> For more info, see [INFO.md](./INFO.md) or [creating a default community health file](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file).
